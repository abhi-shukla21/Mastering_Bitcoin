# Chapter-1 Introduction



Bitcoin consists of:

- A decentralized P2P n/w (the bitcoin protocol)
- A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)
- A set of rules for independent transaction validation and concurrency issuance (consensus rule)
- A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-work algorithm)



### History of Bitcoin

- Invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto in a paper titled "Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer electronic cash system"
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) runs every 10 min. to conduct election to reach at *consensus* about the state of transactions (thus decentralized decision making and solves for double-spend)
- The implementation of PoW algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience for bitcoin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined processing power of world's top supercomputers. Total Market Value (TMV) has exceeded 135 billion USD.



##### ***A solution to a distributed computing problem***

Using PoW to reach a distributed consensus is also a solution to the classing "*Byzantine Generals Problem*"

and has application in different fields such as elections, lotteries, asset registries and much more.
